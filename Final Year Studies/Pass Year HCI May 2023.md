Computer Science is something like hardware, software or programming language so on as to how it affect the mobile. We need to consider which technology to use to develop the mobile. Computer Science is the study of construction of hardware and software. It provides knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of the technology

**Cognitive Psychology** is something like the study of how info is processed and presented in the mind. It provides knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of the users. For example, since the users who are using the app are the elderly people we can design the font size of the app to be more bigger so that the elderly people can more easier to process the info in the app

With a good usability design, we can reduce the learning time for the elderly users when they want to use the app. This increase the productivity of the elderly people so that they can quickly finish their task efficiently when using the app. 

While for the app developer, it will reduce the training time. As the app is easy to use , then they training effort for the developer to training the elderly people will be reduced.

Persona is user models representing individuals, not real people but simulated by observation. It is an important tool at the analysis stage of HCI framework because the system is for the users to use and we can observe the users satisfy or frustrate the system and show behavior patterns.

One advantage of using interview technique compared to questionnaire technique is that it allows more in-depth and nuanced responses. In interview the interviewer can ask follow up question to clarity the respondent's answer and get more detail.

One disadvantage of using interview is it is more time consuming and expensive, in order to conduct interview, interviews need to be scheduled and conducted individually, which can be challenge for large samples.

The limitation of metaphors in user interface design is that they can be confusing or difficult to understand for users who are not familiar with the metaphor. This can lead to frustration and difficulty in completing task.

Learnability, as they are similar elements which might help them to get to know more about our system they used to use our system before. In such a scenario, due to consistency, the user is able to know the function of the navigation bar. Besides, the same design would help the users to feel more comfortable as they don't need to spend extra time to face new page design, function and so on.

Example
Page to Page, color, layout

To tolerate user mistake, for example like when user choose a wrong block to view the detail of the block, there should be an button for them to go back to previous steps as they either perform some mistake when going into the block or they maybe want to explore other blocks when using the system.

Satisfaction is the physical, cognitive and emotional response of a user after using the system. It can be measured by a Test Level Satisfaction. By using Test Level Satisfaction we can get to know the rating of the system from the user satisfaction. Users can either provide the rating by rating star or give the comment.

According to Jakob Neilsen, 5 users are enough for qualitative testing. Nielsen's research has shown that testing with 5 users can uncover 85% of the usability problems in a design. Testing with more users will uncover fewer new problems, and the cost-benefit ratio of testing decreases as the number of users increases.

(i) the system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. For example, using progress bar to let user know how is that status of their downloads.

(ii) We should do careful design which prevents a problem from occuring in the first place. For example, in a form, we only displaying which fields are mandatory.

Light 

- enough lighting should be provided. The lightning level will affect the student when they are viewing the monitor. If the Lightning level is low than the monitor lighting level, the student need to bear with keep viewing the strong light of the monitor, If the lightning level is  high than the monitor lighting level, the student is not able to view the content from the monitor, it hurt their eye as they need to keep watching the monitor for study purpose.

Temperature level

- The student needs a comfortable temperature level to focus on studying. If the temperature is too cold or hot, the student cannot focus on their study as they need to against the comfortable temperature level. For example, if the temperature is too cold, they might want  to keep grabbing some hot drink to help them against the cold temperature. Having a comfortable temperature will assist them to focus on study without disturbing by the uncomfortable temperature.
