Persona is user models representing individuals, not real people but simulated by observation. We can observe the user whether they are satisfy or frustrated when using the system and also show their behavior patterns. 

Hierarchical Task Analysis, this is a analysis whether we find out the  physical steps to complete a task. It is also used to break down tasks to several smaller pieces. It can be used to understand how users complete the task using the current system. By using HTA, users can easily cater to the new system since the flow used is same as before.

Effect on user is the user can make more errors when using the system, which makes the product difficult to use and learn. In result this would decrease the user productivity

While for the developer , the effort for training would be higher as the system is not easy to user, which leads to higher cost and time when the developer is trying to train the new users. In another results, this would ruin the developer's reputation.

Use visual cues to highlight important interactive elements, for example in the parking website, we can show the color of the occupied parking as red and the available parking as green, therefore with the color contrast the user can quickly identify which parking is available by looking at the map

One possible slip is when the user accidentally picked the wrong photo to upload to the cloud, or the mistake might be they accidentally chose the wrong item when trying to upload to the govern store

One possible issue of overtaxing a user's short-term memory is that it can lead to errors. When a user has too much information to hold in their short-term memory, they are more likely to make mistakes. For example a user may forget to take a photo of the price tag or the item, or they may forget to provide the location of the shop. This makes it difficult for the government to investigate the and take action against the offending shop

One solution to this problem is to break down the reporting process into smaller steps and to provide users with feedback. For example, we can prompt users to take photos of the price tag and the item, and to provide the location of the shop, as they are going through the reporting process.

The limitation of metaphors in user interface design is that they can be confusing or difficult to understand for users who are not familiar with the metaphor. This can lead to frustration and difficulty in completing task.

Learnability, As they are similar elements which might help them to get to know more about our system if they used to use our system before. In such a scenario, due to the consistency, the user is able to know the function of the navigation bar. Besides, the same design would help the user feel more comfortable as they don't need to spend extra time to face new page design, function and so-on.
For example, we can use same button style for all primary actions, then for the layout of the website, we ensure the navigation is consistent in every single page, we can also use same terminology throughout the interface, try not use 2 words with the same meaning.

This mainly for novice user who is not familiar with technology, as a normal user we love to undo whenever we make some mistakes. To reduce the online user's anxiety, we have developed the permit easy reversal of actions which allows the user to perform any undo when they accidentally click any button they does not intend to. For example, we can design a go back button when user goes to a specific candidate details which allows the user to go back to previous step to see other candidate details.

Efficiency is the resource including time, human effort and cost used to complete the task achieved. It refers to how fast the work is done. For the usability metric for efficiency is how long it takes a user to complete a task in seconds/minutes.

Cost and time between the users, for some user might be busy for them to conduct a laboratory study because when performing laboratory study we need to have users taken out their normal working environment to take part in the controlled test.

Low Fi sketches are quicker to create. Meanwhile, Low Fi prototypes are helpful in enabling early visualization of alternative design solutions, Furthermore, building an Low Fi prototype is more cheaper than building an High Fi prototype as most of the Low Fi prototype is paper based, sketched by the users. Hence, it does reduce the expenses and at the same time developing Low Fi prototypes is easier to modify if there is any error, design to change. High Fi prototypes take more time to complete as High Fi prototypes are considered as final stage of the system. In addition, it also takes a large amount of time to test/run the system.

Temperature. Why is temperature important to IT programmers ?   
Having air-cond with a comfortable level to the programmers. How can they work efficiently when the temperature is not comfortable at all ? It might affect their productivity.  If the temperature is too hot or too cold, which is not the comfort level, the programmers might not be able to focus on their jobs. Their attention is distracted to against the unusual temperature.(5m) 

  
Lightning. Brightness for instance monitor’s brightness, the light’s brightness and so on. If the brightness is too bright or too sharp, it might make the programmers feel blurry when they are working. The IT programmer wants more than anything else in their working environment, it’s access to natural light. Poor lighting contributes to eye strain, fatigue and reduced productivity. On the contrary, access to plentiful light, especially natural light, can help programmers to improve their productivity. (5m)
